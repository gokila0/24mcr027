ai and ml
ai agents
digital twin

deep learning

specific type of ml using a technique known as a neural network which connects multiple models together to solve even more complex types of problems

linear regression

data by learning the relationship between features of your data and some observed,continues valued response

regression
relationship between variables
it is used to predict a value

k-means for clustering algorithms
group 

neural network
human brain work

recognizing images
predicting stock prices
translating language

input
